# Bank-Customer-Attrition-Prediction

This repository contains code and documentation for a project focused on predicting customer attrition in a banking dataset. The project consists of two main phases: exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling.

Overview
Customer attrition, or churn, is a critical concern for banks as it impacts revenue and customer satisfaction. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify customers at risk of attrition, allowing the bank to take proactive measures to retain them.

Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this phase, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the banking dataset to gain insights into customer behavior and factors influencing attrition. Key steps in the EDA process include:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Visualization: Exploring data distributions, correlations, and trends through histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
Statistical Analysis: Conducting correlation analysis and hypothesis testing to assess relationships between predictor variables and the target variable ('Attrition Flag').

Phase 2: Predictive Modeling
Building upon the insights gained from the EDA phase, we developed a predictive model using the Random Forest Classifier algorithm. The model aims to predict customer attrition based on selected features from the dataset. Key aspects of the modeling phase include:

Model Development: Implementing a Random Forest Classifier and training it on the dataset.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
External Verification: Validating the model's classification results by comparing predictions with actual labels.
